## Game desription:
Game Description: 2-player bomberman game with a minesweeper twist! 

Gameplay: The playing field will be a grid board, with 2 players being free to roam around each square. 
There will be bombs spawning at random around the map, where each player can 'collect' to fill their bomb pouch. 
Then, they can proceed to plant a hidden bomb on whichever square that they may like. 
The objective of the game is to wipe out the other player by planting bombs and coercing them into stepping on the tile with the hidden bomb.
